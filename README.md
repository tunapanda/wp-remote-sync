# wp-remote-sync [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tunapanda/wp-remote-sync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tunapanda/wp-remote-sync)
This plugin synchronises content with a remote wordpress site in a similar way to a distributed version control system.As of now it works to synchronize various resource types which include; posts, attachments and H5P. 

## Setup
* Install the plugin in both local and remote wordpress instances.
* After installation you should now be able to navigate settings>Remote sync in the admin menu.
* From the remote instance set the access key (if it is not already set). 
* Side note: The access key set in <a href="http://learning.tunapanda.org">learning.tunapanda.org</a> is Tunapanda1123.
* From the local instance, set both the remote url and the access key (Must match the remote key).


## How it works
Synchronisation is user driven and all operations are handled from the local endpoint. The user can do operations similar to those git provides, i.e. push, pull, etc. 

## Work in progress
Works, but could use more testing....

## Hacking
* TDD rocks!
  Install wordpress testsuite with `. ./bin/install-wp-tests-local.sh`
* It uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). If you clone the repository, you need to do so using any of these methods:
    1. You can clone it using `git clone --recusrive`.
    2. You can clone it without `--recursive`, and after do `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` inside the
       cloned folder.
